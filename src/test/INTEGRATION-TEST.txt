Product: Integration tests for WSO2 EI Basecamp connector

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically.
   If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
   https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-integration-base

Tested Platform:

 - UBUNTU 16.04
 - WSO2 ESB 5.0.0, EI 6.1.1
 - Basecamp 3

STEPS:
 1. Download EI WSO2 EI 6.1.1 from official website.

 2. Extract the certificate from browser by navigating to https://basecamp.com and place the certificate file in following locations.

	i)  "<Basecamp_Home>/src/test/resources/keystores/products"

		Navigate to the above location from command prompt and execute 'keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "Basecamp"' in command line to import basecamp certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
		NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from basecamp with  the extension, change it accordingly. Remove the copied certificate.

	ii) "<EI_HOME>/repository/resources/security"

		Navigate to the above location from command prompt and execute 'keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "Basecamp"' in command line to import basecamp certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
		NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME is the file name which was extracted from basecamp with  the extension, change it accordingly. Remove the copied certificate.

 3. Ensure that the below mentioned Axis configurations are enabled in the EI.(<EI_HOME>/conf/axis2/axis2.xml).

    <messageFormatter contentType="text/html" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.ExpandingMessageFormatter"/>
    <messageBuilder contentType="text/html" class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>

 4. Create a Basecamp account and derive the access token:
	i) 	Go to "https://www.basecamp.com/" and sign in your basecamp account.
	ii) To Get the Client Id and Client secret
        Go to "https://launchpad.37signals.com/integrations" and register your app, You'll be assigned a Client Id and Client Secret.
	iii) To Obtaining the access token
	   1. First generate the Authentication Code by redirecting your user to Launchpad , with the following query parameters.
             https://launchpad.37signals.com/authorization/new?type=web_server&client_id=your-client-id
                   &redirect_uri=your-redirect-uri
       2. It authenticate the Basecamp ID and ask whether it's ok to give access to your app. Click Yes,I'll allow access.
          If the authentication is successful, the authentication service redirects the you to your redirect_uri.
          The callback contains a code that you will exchange for a token in the next step.
       3. Finally generate the access token by making a POST request to https://launchpad.37signals.com/authorization/token
          with the following headers and parameters.
            https://launchpad.37signals.com/authorization/token?type=web_server&client_id=your-client-id&
            redirect_uri=your-redirect-uri&client_secret=your-client-secret&code=verification-code
          If the request is successful. It will give the access_token and refresh_token.

		vi)   uploadContent       - The String which describes the upload("upload content").
		vii)  projectName         - Project Name to create a Project in the testCreateProjectMandatory method in the integration test(sample).
